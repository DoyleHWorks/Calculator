# Calculator

## About The Project
This is a personal project for learning Swift.

### Built With
[Swift](https://www.swift.org/)
Xcode 16.0 - Playground

### How to Use
Instead of taking user input, please directly input values into the function parameters to check the execution results. Since the Playground does not support input methods like readLine() in a terminal, please use constants or parameters to input values when writing the code.
